recommendation policies:

-	A basic inventory analysis shows three products that are highly undersold, compared to 
        their initial stock quantities. They are 1969 ford Falcon, P-51-D Mustang and 
        Diamond T620 Semi-skirted Tanker from respectively warehouse EAST, SOUTH and NORTH. 
        The company should stop marketing them and free up the space that they occupy in the 
        warehouses, as well the other resources allocated to manage them.

-	Many of customers experience credit limit issue. I will recommend to discuss with them 
        on the plan (at least a payment plan) that they intent to apply to solve the balance. 

-	Over the 98 customers who was recorded, on 2 of them Euro+Shopping Channel from Spain 
        and Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd from USA got the highest rates of sales, with 26 and 17 units 
        of sales respectively. The other customers got 5 or less. This finding need to be supported 
        by a client experience (online survey) for a better understanding of this big difference 
        between the two groups of customers and address  the best CRM to attract the worst customers.
 
-	Over the whole team of 15 employees, only five employees were not able to cross the benchmark 
        of 500,000$ of sales. Managers will improve the production incentive policy and encourage 
        sharing of experiences during meeting to help them learn from other employees.
  
-	The most successful product lines are ships, trucks and buses that are realistic replicas of old models. 
        Some of them include a certificate of authenticity from their manufacturers. These models are usually 
        suitable for present, home and office ornament. Company should ensure a better supply for this kind of 
        products and adopt good price policy for customers who are looking for presents for anniversaries, 
        gift to a co-worker and more.
